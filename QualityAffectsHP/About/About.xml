	<description>[Previously called German Quality] Makes quality affects Hitpoints of things, so higher quality means that items like armor last longer.

Hp factors are:
Awful: x0.5
Poor: x0.75
Normal: x1
Good: x1.75
Excellent: x3
Masterwork: x6
Legendary: x10


With 1.6, there may occasionally be small rounding errors. Meaning some items may have a few hit points more or fewer than the maxHP. I'll hopefully be able to fix this in an update soon.
